# TODOs. 


## Want. 

In descending order of priority: 


- normal finetuning should supported; lora if 
- Support the three datasets -- normalize 



Also: 
- want to be able to support 
- wandb 



### DON'T NEED: 

- Multi-GPU support: too complicated 
- 



## Tasks.

- (10 min) Look for reference implementations. 
- make sure data loads 
- write abstractions? 
- Start populating train.py


## Reference Implementations.

    ... this codebase seems more promising. Also has LoRA support as well.
